        "summary": "<p>Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly and radically changing how we produce and consume information. But it’s a ravenous beast when it comes to data.</p><p></p><p>In order to reach timely and relevant conclusions, it must consume large volumes of accurate data. The large language models that drive much of AI are often trained on public web pages due to their abundance and easy access. However, not all information is available in HTML.</p><p></p><p>Millions of Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) documents contain data in the form of facts, figures, equations, laws and regulations, etc. that could be extremely useful to extract and store. Getting that data out of those PDFs can be a challenge.</p><p></p><p>LlamaIndex’s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.llamaindex.ai/llamaparse&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362713819&amp;usg=AOvVaw2EsHTr1sNhRJg7t24juyyI\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LlamaParse</a> simplifies extracting information from PDFs. Let us show you how it’s done with just a few lines of code.</p><h2>Challenges with parsing PDFs</h2><p>Unlike HTML, which inherently provides some structure to the content it presents, PDF was originally created to preserve the visual look of a printed document. Although the ability to encode structural metadata was eventually added, doing so can be a cumbersome process.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, apps that generate PDFs with included structural metadata often just get it wrong. PDFs generated by Adobe’s InDesign, for example, will often set the reading order of a page based upon the order the designer worked on the elements on that page.</p><h2>What is LlamaParse?</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.llamaindex.ai/llamaparse&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362714526&amp;usg=AOvVaw3rHjuOc-ZIrKZaqMTkQeHv\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LlamaParse</a> is a GenAI-native parsing platform for parsing and transforming complex documents into clean data for LLM applications. LlamaParse integrates with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362714675&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kDCplWad_Qh0KztgOi0nP\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LlamaIndex</a>, the open source data orchestration framework for building <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-large-language-model/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362714803&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tP2RmS_VMjERKaDz-_zhr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">large language model</a> (LLM) applications. LlamaIndex makes it easier to build agents and the contextual data that supports them, leveraging AI to extract information from a number of document formats — including PDFs.</p><p></p><p>LlamaParse is really good at:</p><p></p><p>✅ Parsing a variety of unstructured file types (.pdf, .pptx, .docx, .xlsx, .html, jpeg, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamaparse/features/supported_document_types&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362715236&amp;usg=AOvVaw2hGgMXJ4xiLd6y0r9AxbSt\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">and more</a>).</p><p>✅ Parsing embedded tables accurately into text and semi-structured representations.</p><p>✅ Extracting data from visual elements (images/diagrams).</p><p>✅ Using natural language instructions to customize the output how you want it.</p><h2>Benefits of using LlamaParse for PDF extraction</h2><p>You can parse PDFs on your own or with a standard, non-GenAI-enabled PDF parser. However, using LlamaParse provides numerous improvements:</p><p></p><ul><li>Significantly reduces the time and effort spent on data extraction by leveraging LLM intelligence to reduce the manual work involved in data extraction</li><li>Increases the volume of data available for your GenAI apps by freeing it from its sources</li><li>Converts unstructured data into structured data</li></ul><h2>Extracting and storing information from PDFs using LlamaParse</h2><p>You can use LlamaParse via our UI (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362716368&amp;usg=AOvVaw1vf-my5SRwEiAl-9CuTXsJ\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LlamaCloud</a>), the API, or one of our language SDKs. Below we’ll demonstrate some of LlamaParse’s features using Python. If you would prefer to try LlamaParse without the bother of coding, you can <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/login&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362716538&amp;usg=AOvVaw1SNXNdBvt9d2uvHUOLRlGn\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create a free LlamaCloud account</a> and experiment using some of your own documents.</p><h3>Getting started: Installing LlamaIndex and LlamaParse</h3><p>First we need to install LlamaIndex and LlamaParse to make them available for our Python scripts.</p><p></p><p>Caution: We recommend creating and activating a virtual Python environment before proceeding to avoid issues caused by conflicting dependency versions.</p><pre><code>pip install llama-index\npip install llama-parse</code></pre><h3>API key</h3><p>You also need an API key. To create one, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/login&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362717690&amp;usg=AOvVaw1sts-GKn_FljzpdvxKzDF-\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create a free LlamaCloud account</a>.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/7m9jw85w/production/9a07f3373c43df2983a3f4b1540ec51f59a32a8d-894x735.png?fit=max&amp;auto=format\" /><p>Once you have created an account and are logged in, click API Keys from the left navigation and then the Generate New Key button.<br /></p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/7m9jw85w/production/fcee80081c4f847ebe11642a21fa12c8094d9aea-1304x806.png?fit=max&amp;auto=format\" /><p>Caution: Once your key is displayed, copy it and save it to a secure location. You won’t be able to redisplay it once you dismiss the screen. If you lose your key, you should revoke it and create a new one.</p><p></p><p>We recommend setting your API as an environmental variable in your Python virtual environment.</p><pre><code>export LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=&apos;yourkey12345….&quot;</code></pre><p>Now we’re ready to begin parsing PDF files. Let’s write some code.</p><h3>Parse your first PDF with LlamaParse and Python</h3><p>We’ll begin by parsing a two-page report comparing investment returns from the Nasdaq-100 vs. the S&amp;P 500. You can <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/docs/NDX-vs-SPX_2%2520pager.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362719332&amp;usg=AOvVaw3yW1k9wX39d0X0bZTYEyQX\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">download the PDF file</a> with your browser or by using wget.</p><pre><code>wget https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/docs/NDX-vs-SPX_2%20pager.pdf</code></pre><p>Now we’ll create a simple Python script to parse the PDF file and save its content as markdown.</p><pre><code>from llama_parse import LlamaParse\n\n\nparser = LlamaParse(\n   # api_key=&quot;llx-...&quot;,  # if you did not create an environmental variable you can set the API key here\n   result_type=&quot;markdown&quot;,  # &quot;markdown&quot; and &quot;text&quot; are available\n   )\n\nfile_name = &quot;./NDX-vs-SPX_2 pager.pdf&quot;\nextra_info = {&quot;file_name&quot;: file_name}\n\nwith open(f&quot;./{file_name}&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;) as f:\n   # must provide extra_info with file_name key with passing file object\n   documents = parser.load_data(f, extra_info=extra_info)\n\n# with open(&apos;output.md&apos;, &apos;w&apos;) as f:\n   # print(documents, file=f)\n\n# Write the output to a file\nwith open(&quot;output.md&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;) as f:\n   for doc in documents:\n       f.write(doc.text)</code></pre><p>Save the script as parse.py and then run it.</p><pre><code>python parse.py</code></pre><p>Once the script finishes, open output.md. You’ll see that LlamaParse has successfully extracted the content from the PDF and correctly applied structure via headers. Notice that the table at the bottom of the first page was also recreated in markdown.</p><pre><code>| |Nasdaq-100 TR|S&amp;P 500 TR|\n|---|---|---|\n|Cumulative Return|315%|156%|\n|Annualized Return|13%|9%|\n|Annualized Volatility|22%|20%|</code></pre><h3>Extracting data from charts and graphs</h3><p>However, you may notice that the data from the two graphs on the first page are missing. This is actually by design. LlamaParse supports multiple parsing modes, which allows you to balance speed, cost, and advanced parsing power based upon your needs at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The default mode, which we used above, skips most graphs since they require more advanced and costly processing. But we can enable LlamaParse to utilize a different mode with a slight configuration change to our parser.</p><pre><code>from llama_parse import LlamaParse\n\n\nparser = LlamaParse(\n   # api_key=&quot;llx-...&quot;,  # if you did not create an environmental variable you can set the API key here\n   result_type=&quot;markdown&quot;,  # &quot;markdown&quot; and &quot;text&quot; are available,\n\n    extract_charts=True,\n\n    auto_mode=True,\n\n    auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page=True,\n\n    auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page=True,\n   )\n\nfile_name = &quot;./NDX-vs-SPX_2 pager.pdf&quot;\nextra_info = {&quot;file_name&quot;: file_name}\n\nwith open(f&quot;./{file_name}&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;) as f:\n   # must provide extra_info with file_name key with passing file object\n   documents = parser.load_data(f, extra_info=extra_info)\n\n# with open(&apos;output.md&apos;, &apos;w&apos;) as f:\n   # print(documents, file=f)\n\n# Write the output to a file\nwith open(&quot;output.md&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;) as f:\n   for doc in documents:\n       f.write(doc.text)</code></pre><p>When the parser completes its work, you’ll see, for example, that the industry breakdown chart on the second page has been parsed and rendered as a table.</p><pre><code>Industry (ICB) Breakdown\n\n| Industry | Nasdaq-100 Industry (ICB) Weights | S&amp;P 500 Industry (ICB) Weights |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Technology | 55% | 22% |\n| Consumer Services | 25% | 14% |\n| Health Care | 8% | 13% |\n| Consumer Goods | 6% | 8% |\n| Industrials | 6% | 12% |\n| Telecommunications | 1% | 2% |\n| Utilities | 3% | 3% |\n| Financials | - | 18% |\n| Oil &amp; Gas | - | 5% |\n| Basic Materials | 2% | 2% |</code></pre><p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.cloud.llamaindex.ai/llamaparse/parsing/parsing_modes&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362726480&amp;usg=AOvVaw2pf1GMQTZWhNvP5yci_OH9\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">parsing modes</a> and how LlamaParse auto mode enables you to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/optimize-parsing-costs-with-llamaparse-auto-mode&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362726680&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GumQK5RNfQxQu4HkVOP17\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">optimize your parsing costs</a> by only invoking the premium modes when they are genuinely needed.</p><h3>Storing your data in a vector database</h3><p>Once you’ve extracted your data from the PDF, you can send it to a vector database such as Elasticsearch. You’ll need API keys from <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://openai.com/api/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362726974&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zyAl9ogd9PPx7uPBr0fug\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elastic.co/cloud&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362727068&amp;usg=AOvVaw0IJW7jnIttYGzFj0ekA2ml\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elastic Cloud</a>, as well as a few more dependencies installed including nest_asyncio. From there it’s just a few additional lines of code to store your data.</p><pre><code>from llama_index.vector_stores.elasticsearch import ElasticsearchStore\n\nes_store = ElasticsearchStore(\n    index_name=&quot;llama-parse-docs&quot;,\n    es_cloud_id=es_cloud_id,  # found within the deployment page\n    es_api_key=es_api_key,  # create an API key within Kibana (Security -&gt; API Keys)\n)\n\nfrom llama_index.core.node_parser import SimpleNodeParser\nnode_parser = SimpleNodeParser()\n\nnodes = node_parser.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)\n\nfrom llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, StorageContext\n\nstorage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=es_store)\nindex = VectorStoreIndex(\n    nodes=nodes,\n    storage_context=storage_context,\n    embed_model=OpenAIEmbedding(api_key=openai_api_key),\n)</code></pre><p>We won’t go through the full process here, but we’ve prepared detailed examples of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/run-llama/llama_cloud_services/blob/main/examples/parse/demo_elasticsearch_vectordb.ipynb&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362730585&amp;usg=AOvVaw1BmpKNaBVe-t4AQzcHS99o\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sending extracted data to Elasticsearch</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/run-llama/llama_cloud_services/blob/main/examples/parse/demo_advanced_astradb.ipynb&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362730789&amp;usg=AOvVaw30iqaa25dX6AGhPqyzcliY\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to Astra DB</a> in our repo.</p><h2>Fine-tuning your PDF</h2><p>Almost any document that can be displayed on a computer screen can be saved as a PDF, which, as we discussed earlier, makes it difficult to parse them consistently. LlamaParse supports numerous ways to adjust the parsing instructions fed to the LLM for better results or advanced capabilities.</p><h3>Translate your output</h3><p>Have a document in Spanish but need to store its content in English? LlamaParse can do that.</p><p>Download <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.scusd.edu/sites/main/files/file-attachments/howtohelpyourchildsucceedinschoolspanish.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1742501362731410&amp;usg=AOvVaw3sX6q3YFDRR4091l5csc9M\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this Spanish language document</a>.</p><pre><code>wget https://www.scusd.edu/sites/main/files/file-attachments/howtohelpyourchildsucceedinschoolspanish.pdf</code></pre><p>LlamaParse lets you customize the prompt sent to the LLM that initiates parsing.</p><pre><code>from llama_parse import LlamaParse\n\nparser = LlamaParse(\n   result_type=&quot;markdown&quot;,\n\n    user_prompt=&quot;If the input is not in English, translate the output into English.&quot;\n   )\n\nfile_name = &quot;./howtohelpyourchildsucceedinschoolspanish.pdf&quot;\nextra_info = {&quot;file_name&quot;: file_name}\n\nwith open(f&quot;./{file_name}&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;) as f:\n   # must provide extra_info with file_name key with passing file object\n   documents = parser.load_data(f, extra_info=extra_info)\n\n# with open(&apos;output.md&apos;, &apos;w&apos;) as f:\n   # print(documents, file=f)\n\n# Write the output to a file\nwith open(&quot;output.md&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;) as f:\n   for doc in documents:\n       f.write(doc.text)</code></pre><p>Prompts are incredibly powerful and provide you with granular control of your output.

Some examples are</p><ul><li><strong>Financial Analysis and Benchmarking:</strong> Structured data extraction enables analysts and investors to systematically evaluate a company&#x27;s financial health by organizing key metrics such as revenue, operating income, and net income</li><li><strong>Risk Assessment and Management:</strong> By extracting and structuring information on risk factors disclosed in 10-K reports, organizations can identify and monitor potential risks more effectively</li><li><strong>Investment Decision-Making:</strong> Investors rely on structured data from 10-K reports to assess the viability and potential returns of investment opportunities. Organizing financial statements, management discussions, and market analyses into structured formats enables more accurate evaluations and comparisons, aiding in sound investment decisions.</li></ul><h2>Challenges of Extraction from 10-K/Q Filings</h2><p>While extracting structured data from SEC 10-K/Q filings is high value, it exemplifies the challenges of long-form document extraction.</p><ul><li>These reports often exceed 100 pages and contain densely packed information across multiple sections with varying structures. Traditional extraction methods typically fail because they can&#x27;t maintain context across distant sections of a document or struggle with extraction from tabular data.</li><li>These documents have a loosely defined structure and the reported metrics and sections may differ based on the company&#x27;s operations. We ideally want to capture fields that are common across different companies while still allowing for individual variation in reporting metrics and fields.</li></ul><p>For reference, here is Nvidia’s 2024 10-K filing with the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SEC</a>. We will be using this as an example in this post. To follow along, you can clone the <a href=\"https://github.com/run-llama/llama_cloud_services/blob/main/examples/extract/sec_10k_filing.ipynb\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">notebook</a> from our examples folder. Let&#x27;s see how LlamaExtract addresses the challenges of converting these documents into a structured well-typed format.</p><h2>Building an Effective Extraction Schema</h2><p>The foundation of successful extraction is a well-designed schema. A well-designed schema is one that captures your information of interest and generalizes to your target documents, i.e. documents have the relevant information to populate the fields in the schema, and likewise, the schema contains enough information to specify “how” to extract this data from the target documents.</p><p>For SEC filings, we create a comprehensive schema that captures filing information, company profile, financial highlights, business segments, geographic data, risk factors, and management discussions.</p><p><strong>1. Using Python SDK with Pydantic for Schema Specification</strong> </p><p>We can use our Python SDK to build the schema, which looks like the following. Refer to the notebook for additional classes for extracting financial highlights, information from different financial statements, management discussions, etc.</p><pre><code>from typing import Literal, Optional, List\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass FilingInfo(BaseModel):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Basic information about the SEC filing&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    filing_type: Literal[&quot;10-K&quot;, &quot;10-Q&quot;, &quot;10-K/A&quot;, &quot;10-Q/A&quot;] = Field(\n        description=&quot;Type of SEC filing&quot;\n    )\n    filing_date: str = Field(description=&quot;Date when filing was submitted to SEC&quot;)\n    reporting_period_end: str = Field(description=&quot;End date of reporting period&quot;)\n    fiscal_year: int = Field(description=&quot;Fiscal year&quot;)\n    fiscal_quarter: int = Field(description=&quot;Fiscal quarter (if 10-Q)&quot;, ge=1, le=4)\n\n# Additional model classes for company profile, financial data, etc.\n</code></pre><p><strong>2. Using the Web UI</strong> </p><p>The notebook may give the impression that schema design is a one-shot process which is far from being the case. Usually, you start small, test the schema on a sample document, add descriptions and examples in case of inaccurate extractions and slowly and iteratively build your schema. This part might be easier to do with our <a href=\"https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Web UI</a>. We have provided a pre-defined 10-K/Q extraction schema that you can play around with and modify.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/7m9jw85w/production/40e27a968386dfdf9a481c00e915b43ff1b67cb0-1230x1758.png?fit=max&amp;auto=format\" /><p></p><h3>Tips for Long-Form Document Extraction Schema Design</h3><p>When working with extensive documents like SEC filings, consider these specialized schema design principles:</p><p><strong>1. Strategic Field Optionality</strong> </p><p>For long documents with varying content across different companies or document instances, be strategic about which fields are required versus optional:</p><pre><code># Making fields optional when they might not be present in all filings\nebitda: Optional[float] = Field(\n    None,\n    description=&quot;EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization)&quot;\n)</code></pre><p><em>Too many required fields may force hallucination, while too many optional fields might result in missed information. Find the right balance based on your document set.</em></p><p><strong>2. Clear Field Descriptions</strong> </p><p>In lengthy documents where similar concepts may appear in different contexts, precise field descriptions are essential. The more specific your descriptions, the more accurate your extraction results will be. As you find inaccuracies in the extractions, this is a good place to specify expected behavior by giving examples of what to do and what not to do.</p><pre><code>gross_margin: float = Field(description=&quot;Gross margin percentage&quot;)\nrevenue_percentage: Optional[float] = Field(\n    None, description=&quot;Percentage of total company revenue (not growth rate)&quot;\n)</code></pre><p><strong>3. Hierarchical Organization</strong> </p><p>Structure your schema to mirror the natural organization of the document. This hierarchical approach helps the extraction model maintain context across the document&#x27;s logical sections.<br /></p><pre><code>class SECFiling(BaseModel):\n    filing_info: FilingInfo = Field(description=&quot;Basic information about the filing&quot;)\n    company_profile: CompanyProfile = Field(description=&quot;Essential company information&quot;)\n    financial_highlights: FinancialHighlights = Field(\n        description=&quot;Key financial metrics from this reporting period&quot;\n    )\n    # Additional sections...\n</code></pre><p><strong>4. Include Page Tracking</strong> </p><p>For long documents, tracking where information was found is important for verification. We have included <code>page_numbers</code> in the schema to be able to verify which section of the document was used to source certain data. <em>Page numbers might be off by one due to the relative placement of the page numbers and the surrounding context from which the information is extracted, but it is a quick way to navigate to the relevant sections of the document and sanity test some fields. Providing an easier and more accurate way to cite source documents is high on our roadmap.</em></p><pre><code>page_numbers: List[int] = Field(\n    description=&quot;Page numbers where the financial metrics were extracted from&quot;\n)</code></pre><h2>Assessing Extraction Results</h2><p>Here&#x27;s the relevant section on financial highlights that was extracted. Take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/run-llama/llama_cloud_services/blob/main/examples/extract/sec_10k_filing.ipynb\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">notebook</a> to see the detailed extraction results.</p><pre><code>{\n &apos;financial_highlights&apos;: {\n  &apos;period_end&apos;: &apos;2025-01-26&apos;,\n  &apos;comparison_period_end&apos;: &apos;2024-01-28&apos;,\n  &apos;currency&apos;: &apos;USD&apos;,\n  &apos;unit&apos;: &apos;thousands&apos;,\n  &apos;revenue&apos;: 130497.0,\n  &apos;revenue_prior_period&apos;: 60922.0,\n  &apos;revenue_growth&apos;: 114.23,\n  &apos;gross_profit&apos;: 97858.0,\n  &apos;gross_margin&apos;: 75.0,\n  &apos;operating_income&apos;: 81453.0,\n  &apos;operating_margin&apos;: None,\n  &apos;net_income&apos;: 72880.0,\n  &apos;net_margin&apos;: 55.8,\n  &apos;eps&apos;: None,\n  &apos;diluted_eps&apos;: None,\n  &apos;ebitda&apos;: None,\n  &apos;free_cash_flow&apos;: None,\n  &apos;page_numbers&apos;: [40, 41, 55, 56, 68]\n },\n}</code></pre><p><br /></p><p>The gross margin of 75% was extracted from page 40 below and the revenue figures and are from page 41 in the document. You can verify that the geographic breakdown of revenue is extracted from page 79 correctly.</p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/7m9jw85w/production/00c78ad03d4063217dd8d73827704dfbbb1353fc-2058x712.png?fit=max&amp;auto=format\" /><p></p><h3>LlamaExtract is Available in Public Beta!</h3><p>LlamaExtract is now available for you to try out.

        "published": "Thu, 20 Feb 2025 00:00:00 GMT",
        "summary": "<p>Over the last few weeks, there have been a lot of conversations (<a href=\"https://www.sergey.fyi/articles/gemini-flash-2\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://www.runpulse.com/blog/why-llms-suck-at-ocr\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06445\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a> for example) about using Large Vision Models (LVMs) to parse documents. Those conversations struck a chord with us.</p><p>We’ve long been of the opinion that document parsing has always been a huge pain for developers, and has never been solved in a definitive way. We’re determined to do something about it. In 2023, we realized that Large Language Models (LLMs) could be used to parse documents, so we started building LlamaParse. Our thesis is simple:</p><ul><li>First, we can use traditional techniques to extract text &amp; screenshots from documents</li><li>Then we can feed this to an LLM or LVM and let the model reconstruct the document into a structured form (we use Markdown) to be able to correctly extract tables, titles, etc.</li></ul><p>At first we struggled to get acceptable results due to models hallucinating and/or missing content. But with iteration over time our approach proved to be more generalizable than previous attempts at building document parsers, which utilized multiple models trained to extract different parts of documents, leading to overly complex systems. Our approach also performs better on unusual and unexpected edge cases</p><p>Since we built it, LlamaParse has been used to parse hundred of millions of documents, and is trusted by tens of thousands of developers for their parsing needs.</p><h2>Changes in LlamaParse</h2><p>To be more transparent about how LlamaParse works, we’ve decided to rename our parsing modes. We now offer three simplified choices:</p><ul><li>Fast — the cheapest and fastest parsing</li><li>Balanced — the best cost / speed / accuracy trade-off</li><li>Premium — always be directed to our most accurate parsing technique</li></ul><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/7m9jw85w/production/1034ca475a11ee7f45c38e9456421bb0bd491cda-804x716.png?fit=max&amp;auto=format\" /><p>But for those who want more control, we will let you specify the way you want to parse the document. These options are described below:</p><p></p><img src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/7m9jw85w/production/29dd0d5bdb8f87503c7a3c163a223294e5260478-694x1182.png?fit=max&amp;auto=format\" /><h3>Parse without AI</h3><p>Sometimes, the structure of the document is not that important. In this case we output the raw text out of the document in the unstructured format LLMs understand the best: laid-out text.</p><p>We try to keep the text spatially laid out in the same way as the original document. Our extractor at this level has dozens of great features, including:</p><ul><li>Works with hundreds of file formats, and</li><li>Extracts all images contained in a document</li><li>Uses OCR to transcribe all content that is not machine-readable text in the document</li><li>Fixes common issues such as corrupt fonts, corrupt documents</li><li>And many more!</li></ul><h3>Parse with LLM</h3><p>In this mode, we first use our internal parser to extract text, then feed it to a Large Language Model to reconstruct the document structure. We do this as efficiently as possible, while performing error correction on the LLM output to improve results.</p><h3>Parse with LVM</h3><p>This method uses our internal parser to take screenshots of documents, and feeds those to an LVM. We currently support multiple external LVM model vendors such as OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic and Google and will be adding more in the future. We allow you to provide your own API key if you wish, and only charge a nominal fee for handling the parsing.</p><h3>Parse with Agent</h3><p>In our most advanced mode, we use an agentic workflow to parse the provided document to the best of our ability. This includes using both LVMs and LLMs when needed. This gives us the highest accuracy possible, although this requires more time and is more costly.</p><h3>Other changes</h3><p>With this release, we have also deprecated our old “parsing instructions” system, and replaced it with a clearer combination of system prompts and user prompts, which give you more control over the way your documents are parsed.</p><h2>Going forward</h2><p>We are working hard to further improve LlamaParse. We’re committed to building a faster, cheaper, and more accurate parsing stack, and we are hopeful that we will get to a place where fighting with your parsing tool will be a thing of the past. To do so, we will keep pushing the envelope: integrating and develop new models, trying to solve this problem once and for all.</p><p>While most tools today focus on parsing documents page by page, we believe that documents should be looked at as a whole. We took our first step in this direction with what we called “continuous mode” (now called “Parse with LLM”) and are working hard on improving our whole-document parsing capabilities. It should not matter if a table is split between multiple pages, and the hierarchy of titles should be maintained. We will add options to consider the whole document (and not just pages) in all our parsing modes.</p><p>Currently we are only offer the ability to supply your own model for our LVM mode. We will soon start adding this ability to our other modes, starting with an Agent-based system built on Gemini 2.0. We expect to release this later this week, further improving our current Premium mode.</p><p>You can <a href=\"https://cloud.llamaindex.ai/parse\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">try LlamaParse for free today</a>!

        "summary": "<p><a href=\"https://softiq.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SOFTIQ</a>, headquartered in Poland, operates across Germany, the UK, and the Scandinavian markets, with a strong focus on public projects in Poland. With over 300 employees, 60% of whom are developers, the company has established itself as a trusted partner for major institutions. Recently, SOFTIQ has ventured into the realm of LLM-based applications, led by Adam Marszowski, to bring innovative solutions to both internal and client-facing use cases. Their latest production application is an RFP analyzing agent that revolutionizes public sector tender workflows in Poland&#x27;s construction sector.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p>Public sector construction tenders in Poland are a <a href=\"https://ezamowienia.gov.pl/pl/dane-ogolne-o-zamowieniach/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">US$7b market</a>, with over 17,000 contracts awarded in 2024. The construction industry in Poland faces significant challenges when analyzing public sector tenders:</p><ul><li><strong>Business challenges:</strong> <ul><li><strong>Identifying opportunities</strong>: the traditional method of finding tenders to bid for is based on keyword matching, an inaccurate process that results in processing irrelevant tenders</li><li><strong>Processing</strong>: non-standardized, lengthy tender documents take anywhere from 2 hours to several days to review and extract key information</li><li><strong>Risk Assessment and Reporting</strong>: Generating detailed reports with executive summaries and identifying potential risks is time-consuming, and you need to follow very specific workflows.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Technical challenges:</strong> <ul><li><strong>Scale:</strong> Poland’s <a href=\"https://ezamowienia.gov.pl/pl/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">public tenders platform</a> presents thousands of unstructured documents, often over a hundred pages long each, to process</li><li><strong>Parsing:</strong> Converting these documents into a format suitable for semantic search and AI-driven analysis is difficult</li><li><strong>Multimodality:</strong> Documents often have images such as blueprints containing a wealth of relevant information — easy for human readers but harder for AI to understand</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Solution: Agent for Tender Analysis</h3><p>SoftIQ developed an agent as a SaaS app, <a href=\"http://Przetargi.io\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Przetargi.io</a>, using LlamaIndex Workflows tailored to the construction industry. This agent addresses the complexities of tender analysis with:</p><ul><li><strong>Advanced Document Ingestion</strong>: LlamaIndex facilitates seamless processing of lengthy tender documents, extracting relevant sections for analysis.</li><li><strong>Semantic chunking</strong>: Chunk the document without losing hierarchical information in terms of document layout. This is crucial in the report generation phase.</li><li><strong>Automated Report Generation</strong>: Produces 20-30 page reports that include executive summaries, risk assessments, and recommendations.</li><li><strong>Prompt Engineering and Chain of Thought Reasoning</strong>: Each section of an RFP report follows a specific business process, which has been encapsulated into LlamaIndex Workflows. Thus the reports it outputs mimic the output from manual processes previously used by construction companies and align with industry expectations.</li></ul><h3>Why Choose LlamaIndex?</h3><p>The SoftIQ team have deployed multiple production apps with LlamaIndex with great results, stemming from several advantages:</p><ul><li><strong>Out-of-the-Box Features</strong>: <ul><li>Ready-made document chunking, embedding, and querying capabilities</li><li>Seamless integration for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows including both semantic search and metadata search</li><li>Multimodal parsing makes handling image data a breeze</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ease of Integration</strong>:<ul><li>Minimal friction setting up with <a href=\"http://przetargi.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Przetargi.io</a>’s existing data pipelines.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Scale</strong><ul><li>LlamaIndex easily handles workloads of tens of thousands of documents spanning millions of pages of data</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Results and Market Impact</h3><p><a href=\"http://przetargi.io/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Przetargi.io</a> streamlines tender analysis for construction companies, reducing the time and effort required for tender analysis. The application serves a vast market of construction companies participating in tenders, creating significant value in the Polish construction sector. Key results included:</p><ul><li><strong>Enhanced accuracy</strong>: in addition to saving time processing tenders, accuracy of tender selection improved significantly, resulting in <strong>less wasted effort</strong> on irrelevant tenders compared to traditional keyword-based approaches.</li><li><strong>Client efficiency gains</strong>: clients save anywhere from 3 hours to multiple days per tender, depending on the complexity and length of the documentation. On average, tender analysis time fell to <strong>less than 10 minutes.</strong> One pilot client went from <strong>3 tenders per day per employee to 20-30 tenders per day per employee.</strong></li><li><strong>Rapid development:</strong> LlamaIndex’s simple indexing logic and vector store connections <strong>saved an estimated 2 months of development time</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Other LLM-Based Innovations by SoftIQ</h3><p>In addition to the construction tenders agent, SoftIQ has developed many other innovate LLM-powered applications, including:</p><ol><li><strong>Helpdesk Chatbot</strong> Originally created for internal use, now deployed with a major Polish public institution assisting 1000s of support agents.</li><li><strong>Tender Analysis for Other Sectors</strong> Analyzes tenders in software and lighting industries, tailored for specific client needs.</li><li><strong>Recruitment Tools</strong> AI-powered tools to both generate resumés across languages and a resumé analysis platform that matches candidates to job offers and open positions.</li></ol><h3>Looking Ahead</h3><p>By partnering with LlamaIndex, SOFTIQ has set a new standard for tender analysis in the construction sector and many other domains, showcasing the transformative potential of LLM-based solutions.</p><ul><li>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.llamaindex.ai/enterprise\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LlamaCloud</a>, the turn-key enterprise solution from LlamaIndex</li><li>Read up on <a href=\"https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/workflows/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Workflows</a>, the core building block of agentic solutions in LlamaIndex</li><li><a href=\"https://www.llamaindex.ai/contact\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Get in touch with us</a> to see where LlamaIndex can take your company!</li></ul>",
